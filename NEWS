Package: dChipIO
================

Version: 0.1.5 [2016-01-13]
o BUG FIX: The read functions did not work on big-endian platform
  (e.g. Solaris SPARC), because they read files using the default
  platform endian rather than enforcing little endian.
o CLEANUP: Removed warning on readBin() and "'signed = FALSE' is
  only valid for integers of sizes 1 and 2".


Version: 0.1.4 [2016-01-12]
o CLEANUP: Previous version had a stray Rplots.pdf in tests/.


Version: 0.1.3 [2016-01-12]
